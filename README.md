# Chirping: A Web3 Social Media Platform 🐦

Chirping is a **Web3-powered social media platform** built on the **BNB Testnet Chain**, where every user starts equally and earns recognition based on the value they bring to the community. Posts, likes, and reactions are decentralized, ensuring fairness and transparency, free from the control of a central authority. ✨

Unlike traditional social media, **Chirping gamifies engagement**:  
- If users like your post, they reward you with **Wings 🪽** to help you level up.  
- If they dislike your post, they give you **Cages 🪶**, showing their disapproval.  

As you post meaningful content and gain more Wings, you'll unlock exciting new features and ascend through levels of recognition. 🏆

## 🚀 Features

- **Post Pictures & Write Text**: Share your thoughts or images and let others react to them.  
- **React to Posts**: Reward posts you like with **Wings** or mark ones you dislike with **Cages**.  
- **Decentralized Control**: No central authority—your posts and reactions are secured using blockchain technology.  
- **Level Up System**: Earn recognition and access exclusive features as you engage with the platform.

## 🎯 Challenges

1. **Building Smart Contracts**: Designing robust smart contracts to power the platform.  
2. **Defining User Levels**: Creating fair conditions and a seamless flow for user progression.  
3. **Avoiding Tokenomics**: Since tokenomics can be complex and vulnerable to attacks, the platform does not currently incorporate tokens.
