# Chirping Pitch Deck

## 🐦 What is Chirping?

Chirping is a **Web3-powered social media platform** built on the **BNB Testnet Chain**. It revolutionizes social media by ensuring fairness and transparency through decentralization. Posts, likes, and reactions are gamified and secure, free from the control of a central authority.

**Key Gamification Features:**
- **Wings 🪽:** Rewarded for likes, helping users level up.
- **Cages 🪶:** Given for dislikes, indicating disapproval.

As users post meaningful content and gain Wings, they unlock exciting new features and ascend through levels of recognition. 🏆
